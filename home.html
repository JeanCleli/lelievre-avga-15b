          Sandwich Shop
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our sandwiches are the best, and are rivaled by none. They also come
          in many different types. Sandwiches are great and are apart of a
          balanced diet. I eat one everyday and so should you! Many people are
          scared of sandwiches, but this fear is missplaced. The first step to
          accepting sandwiches into your life is acknowledging the problem
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of services are offered to truley understand the power of a
          sandwich. We offer lessons in sandwich making for those who think they
          are prepared. This is a long four-year course not offered in our
          stores, but in our training facility. Please contact us and apply to
          reserve your spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sandwich Shop also sells all the tools needed to eat and consume a
          sandwich. The most valuable tool is the fork. Contrary to popular
          belief, eating a sandwich is best done with a fork. If you wonder why,
          our four year couse is a good place to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second most important tool is the knife. This is because it is
          imperative to cut the crust for some costumers and consumers. Our
          facilities also engage in cutting edge research to develop new was to
          consume sandwiches. We are looking into incoperating the sporke into
          the sandwich. More info will be told in the four year course.
